tasks:
  - "AI-Powered Trip Generation: 10-stage AI pipeline generates complete, bookable travel offers in under 5 minutes through automated data extraction from emails/forms, destination analysis, accommodation matching, activity planning, transport routing, and price calculation – reduces manual planning time by 90% and enables 10x higher offer capacity"
  - "Unified Inbox & Team Collaboration: Central request management system with multi-source intake (email, form, WhatsApp, API), RFC 5322-compliant email threading implementation, Kanban board/list views, team-based assignment workflow, and role-based access control for scalable multi-tenant SaaS architecture"
  - "Content Management & Media Library: Reusable asset library for accommodations, images, and templates with AI-powered tagging (OpenAI Vision API), Unsplash integration, geographic filtering, and asynchronous background processing via Inngest – centralizes content management and accelerates trip creation"
  - "Subscription & Billing System: Flexible payment integration with multi-provider support (Stripe, Mollie), JSONB-based feature flag system for tiered pricing (Freemium to Enterprise), trial management, usage tracking, and automated lifecycle events for SaaS monetization"
